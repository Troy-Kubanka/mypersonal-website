                <h1>Software Background</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 21px; text-align: left;">In my journey, my exposure to software development and computer science 
                                            began in college, as I hadn't encountered them before. Despite this, my early love for 
                                            mathematics, which fostered critical thinking and a sense of reward, paved the way. High 
                                            school then introduced me to physics, blending math with real-world applications, designs, and 
                                            calculations. I enjoyed combining mathematical thinking with practical logic, so I enrolled 
                                            in college as a declared physics major.<br><br>
                     
                                            My first semester had courses in computer science, math, and physics. I immediately went from zero 
                                            programming exposure to working with Python, C, and C++. Other upper-level students already had software 
                                            development exposure from school, work, or family. I felt out of place, but in hindsight, this was a good 
                                            thing because it challenged me to work harder. I spent a lot of extra time on my coursework, and learning 
                                            computer science went from my most difficult subject to my favorite subject. The potential fell endless.
                                            After my first semester, I committed to majoring in computer science, and strive to be the best in my class.<br><br>
                                            
                                            Today I am eager to continue my interests and use my skills in the tech field. I enjoy understanding the computer 
                                            science fundamentals while also learning up-to-date technologies. It is rewarding, 
                                            exciting, and always evolving. My only regret is that I did not start sooner.<br><br>
